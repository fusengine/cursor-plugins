<objective>
Covers SwiftUI fundamentals shared across all Apple platforms: composable views and modifiers, navigation (NavigationStack for stack-based flows, NavigationSplitView for multi-column layouts), data persistence with SwiftData (@Model, replacing Core Data for most cases), state management (@State for local, @Observable for shared, @Environment for injection), Liquid Glass styling, and App Intents for Siri/Shortcuts integration.

References cover views/modifiers, navigation, SwiftData, state management, Liquid Glass across platforms, and App Intents in depth.

Best practices: extract subviews when a view body mixes responsibilities, keep source files within `FUSE_SOLID_MAX_LINES` (default 200), compose with ViewBuilder and modifiers, always include #Preview, use semantic colors (.primary/.secondary), add accessibility labels to icons, and adapt layout by size class.

# SwiftUI Core

SwiftUI fundamentals shared across all Apple platforms.

## Agent Workflow (MANDATORY)

Before ANY implementation, use `TeamCreate` to spawn 3 agents:

1. **fuse-ai-pilot:explore-codebase** - Analyze existing SwiftUI patterns
2. **fuse-ai-pilot:research-expert** - Verify latest SwiftUI docs via Context7/Exa
3. **mcp__apple-docs__search_apple_docs** - Check SwiftUI view patterns

After implementation, run **fuse-ai-pilot:sniper** for validation.

## Overview

### When to Use

- Building SwiftUI views and components
- Implementing navigation (NavigationStack, SplitView)
- Data persistence with SwiftData
- State management (@State, @Observable)
- Custom view modifiers and layouts

### Why SwiftUI Core

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Declarative UI | Less code, automatic updates |
| Cross-platform | Same code for iOS/macOS/watchOS/visionOS |
| @Observable | Simple reactive state |
| SwiftData | Modern persistence with minimal code |

---

## Key Concepts

### Views & Modifiers
Composable UI building blocks. Extract subviews when responsibilities diverge.

### Navigation
NavigationStack for stack-based, NavigationSplitView for multi-column.

### SwiftData
Modern persistence with @Model. Replaces Core Data for most use cases.

### State Management
@State for local, @Observable for shared, @Environment for injection.

## Best Practices

1. **Cohesive views** - Extract subviews when responsibilities diverge; use `FUSE_SOLID_MAX_LINES` (default 200) as the only source-size ceiling
2. **Composition** - Use ViewBuilder and modifiers
3. **Preview-driven** - Always include #Preview
4. **Semantic colors** - Use .primary, .secondary
5. **Accessibility** - Add labels to icons
6. **Platform adaptation** - Check sizeClass for responsive layouts
