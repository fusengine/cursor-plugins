<objective>
SOLID Python enforces a modular architecture for Python 3.12+: every feature lives under `modules/[feature]/` (routes, services, repositories, interfaces, models) with shared code in `core/`, interfaces are defined with `typing.Protocol` and live only in `interfaces/` directories, type hints are mandatory on every signature, and every public function carries a docstring.

Before writing any new code it requires a DRY check against `core/services` and `core/interfaces`. See `principles.md` for the 5 SOLID principles and `patterns.md` for directory layout, testing, and typing conventions.

# SOLID Python - Modular Architecture

## Agent Workflow (MANDATORY)

Before ANY implementation, use `TeamCreate` to spawn 3 agents:

1. **fuse-ai-pilot:explore-codebase** - Analyze existing architecture
2. **fuse-ai-pilot:research-expert** - Verify Python docs via Context7
3. **fuse-ai-pilot:sniper** - Post-implementation validation

---

## DRY - Reuse Before Creating (MANDATORY)

**Before writing ANY new code:**
1. **Grep the codebase** for similar interfaces, services, or logic
2. Check shared locations: `core/services/`, `core/interfaces/`
3. If similar code exists -> extend/reuse instead of duplicate
4. If code is genuinely shared across features -> create it in `core/`

---

## Architecture (Modules MANDATORY)

| Layer | Location | Responsibility |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Routes | `modules/[feature]/routes/` | HTTP I/O |
| Services | `modules/[feature]/services/` | Business logic |
| Repositories | `modules/[feature]/repositories/` | Data access |
| Interfaces | `modules/[feature]/interfaces/` | Contracts |
| Models | `modules/[feature]/models/` | Domain data |
| Shared | `core/{services,interfaces,models}/` | Cross-feature code |

**NEVER use flat `src/` structure - always `modules/[feature]/`**

---

## Critical Rules (MANDATORY)

| Rule | Value |
|------|-------|
| Source-size ceiling | `FUSE_SOLID_MAX_LINES` (default 200) |
| Routes | Delegate to services; split by responsibility when cohesion drops |
| Interfaces | `interfaces/` directory ONLY |
| Docstrings | Every public function documented |
| Type hints | MANDATORY on all signatures |
| Protocols | Use `typing.Protocol` for interfaces |
| Small interfaces | Keep each Protocol role-focused |

---

## Reference Guide

| Topic | Reference | When to consult |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| **SOLID Principles** | [principles.md](references/principles.md) | Quick reference for all 5 principles |
| **Patterns & Structure** | [patterns.md](references/patterns.md) | Directory layout, testing, typing |

---

## Forbidden

| Anti-Pattern | Fix |
|--------------|-----|
| Source files exceeding `FUSE_SOLID_MAX_LINES` (default 200) | Split by responsibility |
| Interfaces in impl files | Move to `interfaces/` directory |
| Fat interfaces mixing client roles | Split into focused Protocols |
| Flat `src/` structure | Use `modules/[feature]/` |
| Concrete dependencies | Use Protocol + dependency injection |
| Missing type hints | Add type annotations to all signatures |
