# Fusengine hook entrypoint — shipped inside every plugin as scripts/hook.sh.
#
# Resolves the shared harness itself so the plugin works from the Cursor
# marketplace, where no installer ever runs. Order:
#   1. the vendored install under $HOME/.cursor/.fusengine-global (fast path)
#   2. a self-heal `bun install` of that same shared directory, once
#   3. `npx` on latest (last resort, network)
#
# Always tracks the LATEST published harness: the vendored manifest uses the
# `latest` dist-tag and the npx fallback resolves it too, so a new release is
# picked up without editing 21 wrappers.
#
# Resolution is relative to THIS file, never to the caller's cwd. Always exits 0
# on its own failures: Cursor fails hooks open, and a broken guard must never
# block the user's action.
#
# Usage (from hooks/hooks.json): ./scripts/hook.sh [scope...]
