<objective>
Skill Creator scaffolds a complete `SKILL.md` + `references/` structure following the project's skill conventions: conceptual references (WHY + WHEN) separated from copy-paste-ready templates. Every generated file uses `FUSE_SOLID_MAX_LINES` as the only file-size ceiling (positive integer, default `200`). It covers four flows -- creating a brand-new skill, restructuring one that doesn't follow the pattern, improving a skill missing references or with outdated content, and adapting an existing skill to a different framework -- each ending with native Cursor discovery verification, plus Claude compatibility registration only when that compatibility target is explicitly in scope, then a `fuse-ai-pilot:sniper` validation pass.

It generates the skill's structural and documentation content only, not the skill's substantive technical guidance -- that must come from `research-expert` + `explore-codebase` findings gathered before writing.
</objective>

# Skill Creator

## Agent Workflow (MANDATORY)

Before ANY skill creation, delegate these two independent tasks through Cursor's native subagent or
`Task` surface when it is available:

1. **fuse-ai-pilot:explore-codebase** - Check existing skills, analyze structure
2. **fuse-ai-pilot:research-expert** - Fetch latest official documentation online

Then call **mcp__context7__query-docs** separately for official examples. Context7 is an MCP tool
call, not a third agent.

After creation, run **fuse-ai-pilot:sniper** for validation.

## Overview

| Action | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| **New Skill** | Library/framework not yet documented |
| **Restructure** | Existing skill doesn't follow pattern |
| **Improve** | Missing references or outdated content |
| **Adapt** | Copy from similar skill (Next.js → React) |

---

## Critical Rules

1. **ALL content in English** - Never French or other languages
2. **SKILL.md is descriptive** - Guides agent to references/templates
3. **References are conceptual** - WHY + WHEN; keep every file within `FUSE_SOLID_MAX_LINES`
4. **Templates are complete** - Copy-paste ready code
5. **Verify native Cursor discovery** - Use `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` or an explicit
   `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` `skills` path; Claude registration is compatibility-only
6. **Run sniper after creation** - Validate all files

|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Workflow** | [workflow.md](references/workflow.md) | Creating/improving skills |
| **Architecture** | [architecture.md](references/architecture.md) | Understanding skill structure |
| **Content Rules** | [content-rules.md](references/content-rules.md) | Writing references/templates |
| **Registration** | [registration.md](references/registration.md) | Making skill available |
| **Adaptation** | [adaptation.md](references/adaptation.md) | Converting between frameworks |

### Templates

| Template | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| [SKILL-template.md](references/templates/SKILL-template.md) | Creating new SKILL.md |
| [reference-template.md](references/templates/reference-template.md) | Creating reference files |
| [template-template.md](references/templates/template-template.md) | Creating code templates |

## Quick Reference

### Create New Skill

```bash
# 1. Research documentation
→ research-expert + context7/exa

# 2. Create structure
mkdir -p plugins/<agent>/skills/<name>/references/templates

# 3. Create files
→ SKILL.md (from template)
→ references/*.md (conceptual)
→ references/templates/*.md (code)

# 4. Verify discovery
→ native skills/ folder or explicit .cursor-plugin/plugin.json path
→ Claude compatibility registration only when explicitly targeted

# 5. Validate
→ sniper
```

### Improve Existing Skill

```bash
# 1. Analyze
→ explore-codebase

# 2. Research updates
→ research-expert (latest docs)

# 3. Add missing files
→ references + templates

# 4. Validate
→ sniper
```

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] ALL content in English
- [ ] SKILL.md has proper frontmatter
- [ ] All references listed in frontmatter
- [ ] Agent Workflow section present
- [ ] Reference Guide has Concepts + Templates tables
- [ ] Every file is within `FUSE_SOLID_MAX_LINES` (positive integer, default `200`)
- [ ] Templates have complete, working code
- [ ] Native Cursor discovery verified
- [ ] Claude compatibility registration added only when explicitly targeted

## Best Practices

### DO
- Research official docs before writing
- Use tables for organization
- Link references to templates
- Keep references conceptual
- Make templates copy-paste ready

### DON'T
- Write in French (English only)
- Copy-paste raw documentation
- Exceed `FUSE_SOLID_MAX_LINES` in any generated file
- Forget registration step
- Skip sniper validation
