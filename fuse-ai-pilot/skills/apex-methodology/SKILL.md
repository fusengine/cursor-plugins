<objective>
APEX Methodology drives the full Analyze -> Plan -> Execute -> eLicit -> eXamine workflow for any development task -- new features, bug fixes, refactors, hotfixes. It auto-detects the project type (Laravel, Next.js, React, Swift) and loads the matching framework-specific reference set, then walks through branch creation, brainstorming, codebase analysis, planning, TDD execution, expert self-review (eLicit), functional verification, and sniper validation (eXamine) through to PR creation.

APEX requires the project's hard constraints throughout: `FUSE_SOLID_MAX_LINES` (default `200`) as the only file-size ceiling, interfaces kept out of component files, SOLID principles, and a mandatory sniper pass after every write. The agent must perform these requirements directly; the postToolUse/core-guards hooks are intended to reinforce them with reminders, but automatic end-to-end Cursor enforcement remains runtime-unverified in the inspected unpinned harness. Three modes control how much is automatic: `--auto` (default, no prompts), `--manual` (step-by-step confirmation), and `--skip-elicit` (bypasses the self-review phase).

**Current Task:** $ARGUMENTS

# APEX Methodology Skill

**Analyze → Plan → Execute → eLicit → eXamine**

Complete development workflow for features, fixes, and refactoring.

---

## Step 0: Initialize Tracking (MANDATORY FIRST ACTION)

**BEFORE anything else**, initialize APEX tracking — see `references/init-tracking.md` for the exact command.

This creates `.cursor/apex/task.json` (documentation consultation status) and `.cursor/apex/docs/` (consulted documentation summaries). The agent MUST NOT Write/Edit until documentation is consulted. The preToolUse hooks are intended to deny qualifying operations until that consultation is recorded, but actual Cursor blocking remains runtime-unverified in the inspected unpinned harness.

## Core Rules

### File Size (ABSOLUTE)

```text
FUSE_SOLID_MAX_LINES is the only file-size ceiling.
Resolve it as a positive integer; default to 200.
Split any file that would exceed the resolved ceiling.
```

### Interface Location

```text
✅ src/interfaces/     (global)
✅ src/types/          (type definitions)
✅ Contracts/          (PHP/Laravel)
❌ NEVER in component files
```

### Agent Usage

```text
01-analyze:  explore-codebase + research-expert (PARALLEL)
04-validate: sniper (MANDATORY after ANY change)
```

---

## NEVER

```text
❌ Skip explore-codebase or research-expert
❌ Assume API syntax without verification
❌ Create files exceeding `FUSE_SOLID_MAX_LINES` (default `200`)
❌ Put interfaces in component files
❌ Skip sniper after changes
❌ Merge without tests
❌ Incohesive or unreviewable PRs
```
